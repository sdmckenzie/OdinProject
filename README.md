# My Odin Project

This repository is where I'm storing the html, css, and javascript that I write while I work my way through the Odin Project material. The rough directory structure is as follows:

1. Experiment -- the directory where I play with the content from the project course
2. Projects -- the directory where I store the projects completed as part of the Odin Project. Each project will be contained inside of its own directory
3. Notes -- the directory where I will keep various notes that I may want to refer back to, or cheat sheets that I find helpful.
