	<h1>Today is Friday</h1>

<p>Today was a pretty normal day at the office. It ended with us being <em>very annoyed</em> with some fo the ways they're tracking us. One hundred percent productivity is 7 hours and 40 minutes of work. <strong>Yikes!</strong></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The problem is that we don't quite understand how that time metric is tracked. Today it seemed apparent to me that the time metric is based on the amount of time logged to a ticket whent he ticket is closed. In other words, <em>none</em> of the time counts until the ticket is set to a status of closed or resolved.</p>

<h3>Fuck.</h3>
